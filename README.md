# Answer Set Programming
> A place where I save ASP code written in clingo

I am a master's student in the [Cognitive Systems](https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/cogsys/) program at Universit√§t Potsdam.  One of the core modules in the program focuses on answer set programming using a language known as Clingo.  This is currently the technology I am using to work on my master's thesis.  My work is stored in a private respository within the [Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) group](https://github.com/krr-up) on GitHub, but materials I share here in my personal time will be kept public.
